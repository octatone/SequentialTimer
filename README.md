SequentialTimer
===============

A chrome app timer in progress. I'll think of a better name for this later when it is done.


Why?
====

Because I want one that syncs across all my computers.  That repeats indefinately, is infinately complex, and that keeps ticking even if I close the window.

And to learn a bit o' yeoman and more about the chrome app architecture and apis.

And because I can.
